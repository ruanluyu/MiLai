#Lua Code
---

>*Lua is a lightweight, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language designed primarily for embedded use in applications.* [——Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language))

**Version : [Lua5.3](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/)**

So Lua plays the roll that manages communication between Ae and Users. We only provide this environment and few convenience functions for you to use. In Lua, you can : 
- Get pixels data
- Write pixels data
- Run JavaScript
- Run GLSL
- Get paramters data
- Run outer C library **(COOL!)**
- Load outer lua module

Because of the advanced features, the users who using Lua render mode should have basic programming abilities and have a primary understanding about Lua language. If you have no idea about Lua, don't warry about it, it is pretty familiar with the expressions in Ae and the JavaScript.
