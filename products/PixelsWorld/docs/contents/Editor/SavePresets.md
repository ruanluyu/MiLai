# Preset Management
-------
## Saving Presets
In the [World Law Editor](ScriptWindow.md), you can save a preset by clicking the `Save as preset` button and entering a name.
> Note: If you use a preset name that already exists in the list, it will be overwritten.

## Overwriting Presets
In the [World Law Editor](ScriptWindow.md), you can overwrite an existing preset by clicking the `Save as preset` button and entering the name of a **preset that already exists** in the list.
> Note:
> - This action is irreversible, please make sure to back up.
> - Preset names in **different preset categories** do not interfere with each other.

## Renaming Presets

Double-click on the preset in the list that you want to rename, and enter a name **other than** `REMOVE` or `SORT` in the input field.

## Sorting the Preset List

Double-click on any preset in the list and enter `SORT` in the input field.

## Deleting Presets

Double-click the preset you wish to delete in the list and enter `REMOVE` in the input field.

## Adding Preset Categories

Click the `Add` button next to the drop-down list in the `Preset list` panel to add a new preset category.
> Note:
> - You cannot use an existing category name for a new category.
> - Adding a category is equivalent to creating a preset file alongside the plugin. *If creation fails or the preset file disappears the second time you open After Effects, please enable administrator mode for After Effects to allow Pixel World to read/write on your disk.*

## Preset Format/Preset File

- Presets are stored in JSON format with UTF-8 (little-endian) encoding.
- Preset files are stored in plain text; we do not encrypt presets in any way.
- Preset files can be modified using third-party JSON editing tools, but there is a risk of damaging the preset structure, which is not recommended.

## Preset Submission

If you are willing to publicly share your presets through official channels, you are welcome to submit your presets to the email: `ZzStarSound@gmail.com`.

We will periodically compile received presets and publicly list submitters' names in the plugin's `About` section.
