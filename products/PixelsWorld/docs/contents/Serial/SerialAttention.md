# Serial Number Usage Agreement
------

> Note: These terms do not apply to customers who purchased on the aescripts.com platform.

1. A serial number contains N "**registrations**" (N is greater than or equal to 1).
2. One "**registration**" permanently registers one computer.
3. One computer's "**registration**" can be used across multiple versions of Ae.
4. Registering a computer will **decrease one "registration"**, while unbinding an already registered computer will **increase one "registration"**.
5. Only **registering and unbinding** require an internet connection; after registering, the software can be used offline.
6. Before replacing your motherboard or CPU, please unbind the serial number and re-bind it after the replacement. If you forget to unbind the serial number, please [contact us by email](mailto:zzstarsound@gmail.com).
7. The serial number is not tied to any personal information. It is allowed but **not recommended** to share or resell among friends. If shared or resold, any issues or benefits resulting from this are not the responsibility of the Future Vision Animation Group.
8. By default, only one "registration" is included with purchase. If you have multiple devices and wish to use Pixel World simultaneously on them, please purchase the appropriate number of Pixel World serial numbers, and we will send serial numbers with the corresponding number of "registrations".
